"""Reads the real per-brawler trophy count off the screen.

The bot's own counter is not read from the game: `trophy_observer` starts from
whatever number is in the queue and keeps adding its own computed deltas. That
number drifts further from reality with every match, and it is what the
"reached the target" check compares against, so a brawler that is 43 trophies
short looks 643 short and the bot plays it forever.

Two figures are read here:

* the selected brawler's own trophy count, in the middle of the lobby, and
* the account's trophy total, in the yellow bar under the crown badge.

The account total is the one that can carry a trophies-per-hour rate, because it
does not restart when the brawler changes.
